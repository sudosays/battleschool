#+title: Welcome to Battle School

This is a collection of programming problems that I use to practice different
languages and to try and stay sharp.

Each solution file should contain documentation on how the problem was
approached. However, the solutions should be checked against their sources. This
is only to collect the answers and their problem specifications.

The name is a reference to Ender's Game.
